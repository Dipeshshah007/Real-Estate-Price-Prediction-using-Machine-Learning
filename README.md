🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate property prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to build a regression model capable of accurately estimating property values based on key features such as house age, location factors, distance to amenities, and other real estate indicators.

Accurate real estate valuation plays a crucial role in:
Property investment decisions
Risk assessment
Market trend analysis
Automated valuation systems (AVMs)
This project simulates a real-world housing price prediction system used in PropTech and financial analytics industries.
